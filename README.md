# Family Gift Exchange
A python GUI (planned to be an executable) to manage and run family gift exchanges when it isn't possible for everyone to get together.

## Project Overview
Have you ever wanted to do a holiday gift exchange with friends and family but getting everyone together at the same place at the same time is just logistically and/or geographically impossible?  Well, you've come to the right place.

The FamilyGiftExchange python application allows you to create and manage gift exchanges for multiple families.  Each family is saved in its own sqlite3 SQL database, with email, address, and (if applicable) significant other information; allowing you to manage different sides of the family, friend groups, and even office gift exchanges all in one application.

You can generate name draws for a new year, input gifter-giftee assignments from previous years (if you had been tracking your own gift exchanges manually, for instance, review the exchanges from previous years, and more.

_This is a work in progress as I get myself used to using GitHub.  I wouldn't recommend using things just yet, but if the idea is intriguing, keep an eye on the repository and feel free to add comments._
